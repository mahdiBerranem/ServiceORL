Mom how are you ! are you fine !
i'm writing a letter i don't know how and why 
i was happy mom 
when i went back home full of joy and pleasure ..
when i saw the tears of happiness in your eyes ...
dad i miss sitting with you
where i found my comfort and with your pure words my days will be blessed
Now its over 
i woke up from the dreams when i did not live with you neither Eid nor mouloud nor ramdan
i was always far from you , mountains and weapon were my only friends
in the night when you fall asleep i guard you
mom ,my lover and my friends
briefly
houses are destroyed , fear was all over the place. between a minute to another, it turned to volcano.
between a minute to another,smoke came out. both period and time stopped.
I am not the only one mom,im so sorry it is my fate.
thanks god we died on the certificate.  
 
 i know it is very difficult but it's okay , our country deserves this. like men sacrificed for you ,
 they will do it again. as you always said mom "live like a man , your body will die but your name will stay alive".
history will record and humanity must remember.
Goodbey.
